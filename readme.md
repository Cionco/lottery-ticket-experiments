This repository holds the python notebooks in which the experiments for the Master Thesis "Winning Lottery Tickets in Deep Neural Networks" were run.
These are to be enjoyed with care. Experiments did not always run in sequence and some plots are results of non-final versions of the framework.
If you are interested in using the framework, the documentation inside the frameworks code should be sufficient. Here are mostly examples of how it can be used.

The repository for the framework itself can be found at: https://github.com/Cionco/lottery-ticket
